Please create a scientific calculator using c++, with the rules below:

1. The calculator should have + - / :   (10 points)                                                                         || DONE                         
2. Basic trigonometry function: sin cos tan (10 points)                                                                     || DONE
3. More than basic function: square root, exp, log, ln (15 points)                                                          || DONE
4. The calculator can input up to 10 or more variables and parameters. It is not limited to 2 + 2, 3 x 3, etc. (15 points)  ||
5. Inside the code, you apply the class function (separate class, inline class, constructor, etc.) (20 points)              ||
6. Inside the code, you apply the linked list or queue function (20 points)                                                 ||
7. It can delete and show the history of the calculator (10 points)                                                         ||
